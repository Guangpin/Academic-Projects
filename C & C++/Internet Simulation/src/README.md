Source Files
============

This Folder contains the Source files required to run the program. If you intend to run the Project yourself, I recommend that you use the Bash Console, or else the Debugger may start acting strange.

**File Descriptions:**
 - `Main.cpp`: Runs the Program and Interprets the Command Line
 - `Node.h`: Defines the Node Class and the methods respective to the Node
 - `DataLink.cpp`: Defines the Data Link Layer within the Node Class
 - `Network.cpp`: Defines the Network Layer within the Node Class
 - `Transport.cpp`: Defines the Transport Layer within the Node Class
 - `Reader.h`: Defines the Reader Class, which is responsible for Reading from Open-Stream Files
 - `Writer.h`: Defines the Writer Class, which is responsible for Writing to Open-Stream Files
 - `Debug.h`: Defines the Debug Class, which helps provide Output and also helps Debug the Project
 - `makefile`: Defines Commands for Compiling, Cleaning, and Clearing the Project
