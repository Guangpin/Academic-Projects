Memory/CPU Simulation
===================

Simulates the Memory and CPU of a Computer using Pipes to Communicate

**Team Members:** Brian Quackenbush, Tyler Reed, Ashley Tharp

**Files:** main.cpp, CPU.h, CPU.cpp, Memory.h, Memory.cpp, makefile, program.txt, interrupt.txt

**File Descriptions:**

- **CPU.h** - Holds the CPU class definition
- **CPU.cpp** - Holds the CPU function definitions
- **Memory.h** - Holds the Memory class definition
- **Memory.cpp** - Holds the Memory function definitions 
- **main.cpp** - Runs the program and forks the process
- **program.txt** - Contains a program for printing a picture of a bunny
- **interrupt.txt** - Contains an interrupt routine for printing the number of times it has been called

**How To Compile**: Download Source files from *src* Directory. Run **makefile** with the '*make*' Command in the directory where the Program has been downloaded *(Note: Our implementation assumes your program file is named 'program.txt')*.

**How To Run**: Run the **Simulation** executable with the *./Simulation* command
